students routinely receive dramatically different learning opportunities 
based on their social status. The the education quality between different regions are hugely different.
 And only 10% high school student in low income take SAT OR ACT and apply to college. 

According to a study, one-third of teachers do not have an education background in the main subject that they teach. 
And, more than 20 percent have less than five years of teaching experience. 
About nine percent are teaching without the usual state certification. 
These incapable teachers often cannot deliver useful and helpful lecture to their students.

And they cannot give feedback to their students on time. 
And many students always complain about their teacher doesn’t pay enough attention and spend enough time to help them, 
so it cause the huge barrier between students and teacher.

 Personalized learning can also give students the chance to build self-advocacy skills. It encourages them to speak up about what interests them. 
It also allows them to be equal partners in their learning experience. But in the current education system, 
teachers are unable to provide personalized learning because all their time is spent on grading and preparing lesson plans. 
This makes many students not interested in learning, and also leads to their poor academic performance.

the same poor eating habits that led to the obesity problem may also be contributing to lower student achievement. 
Obesity also increases a student’s risk for other conditions, like diabetes and high blood pressure, 
which could result in higher absenteeism and more academic issues. 
But few schools provide education in diet and exercise because there are not enough specialist teachers.
